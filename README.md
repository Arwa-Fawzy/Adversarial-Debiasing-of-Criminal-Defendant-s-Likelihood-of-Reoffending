# Adversarial Debiasing of Criminal Defendant's Likelihood of Reoffending

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of **Adversarial Debiasing** to reduce bias in predicting the likelihood of reoffending (recidivism) using the COMPAS dataset.

COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) is a widely used algorithm that assesses the likelihood of criminal defendants reoffending. However, it has been shown to exhibit bias, particularly with respect to race. This project aims to mitigate that bias using adversarial debiasing techniques.
